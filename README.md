# ðŸŽ¤ Talks & Presentations by Thanh Cuong (Alex) Nguyen

Welcome to my **Talks** repository â€” a curated collection of academic and professional presentations I had delivered. 
Each folder contains a self-contained **Quarto slideshow** (Reveal.js) or **PDF version** of the talk, with code and datasets where applicable.
